# Sampling-from-a-Distribution

This project explores sampling from a 2D Gaussian distribution using Python libraries Numpy and Matplotlib. Key tasks include:

Drawing 100 samples from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of [0, 0] and an identity covariance matrix, and visualizing them using scatter plots.
Analyzing scatter plot changes when:
The mean is changed to [1, 1].
The variance of each component (x₁ & x₂) is doubled.
The covariance matrix is modified to:
[[1, 0.5], [0.5, 1]]
Other covariance matrix configurations.
